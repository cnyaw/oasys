OASYS stands for Object-Oriented Adventure System. It is a system designed
for writing text adventure games. The "Object-Oriented" in the title means
that the system is built around the objects that appear in the game. This
means that you can write adventure games faster and more easily than with
older systems.

OASYS 1.0 was written by Russell Wallace, RWALLACE@vax1.tcd.ie

This distribution is OASYS version 1.01 due to the changes made below.

The code OALIB.H and OALIB.C are meant to replace RWLIB.H and RW.LIB,
respectively.  All of this code was given by R. Wallace but was not
originally distributed with the system.  All references to RWLIB.C
and RW.LIB in documentation and sources have been changed to refer to
OALIB.H and OALIB.C.  Other changes were made to the sources to make
them portable to a wider range of systems and compilers.  A generic
makefile is also included.  These changes are also made public domain.
This source is known to compile with Borland C++ on MSDOS. Since the
changes were minimal I suspect that it will still compile under the
Zortech C++ compiler as well.  It was my intent to test this with GNU
C++ on MSDOS, OS/2 and Unix.  But I have not tried compiling on these
systems yet (although it should compile with little or no changes).
Please let me know if you are successful compiling with other systems
I would also like to know the changes that you made in order to do so.
